This content is a distillation of many successful implementations by Salesforce architects and partners.
Read the pattern summary and selection matrix if you’re considering large-scale adoption of Salesforce-based applications (or the
Lightning Platform) to become familiar with the integration capabilities and options available. Architects and developers should consider
these pattern details and best practices during the design and implementation phase of a Salesforce integration project.
If implemented properly, these patterns enable you to get to production as fast as possible and have the most stable, scalable, and
maintenance-free set of applications possible. Salesforce’s own consulting architects use these patterns as reference points during
architectural reviews and are actively engaged in maintaining and improving them.
As with all patterns, this content covers most integration scenarios, but not all. While Salesforce allows for user interface (UI)
integration—mashups, for example—such integration is outside the scope of this document. If you feel that your requirements are
outside the bounds of what these patterns describe, speak with your Salesforce representative.",,Documentation,Sam Mital,https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/sfdc/pdf/integration_patterns_and_practices.pdf,
